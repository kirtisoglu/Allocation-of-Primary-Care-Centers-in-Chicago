class SingleMetricOptimizer:
    """
    SingleMetricOptimizer represents the class of algorithms / chains that optimize plans with
    respect to a single metric.  An instance of this class encapsulates the following state
    information:
        * the dual graph and updaters via the initial partition,
        * the constraints new proposals are subject to,
        * the metric over which to optimize,
        * and whether or not to seek maximal or minimal values of the metric.

    The SingleMetricOptimizer class implements the following common methods of optimization:
        * Simulated Annealing
        * Tilted Runs

    Both during and after a optimization run, the class properties `best_part` and `best_score`
    represent the optimal partition / corresponding score value observed.  Note that these
    properties do NOT persist across multiple optimization runs, as they are reset each time an
    optimization run is invoked.
