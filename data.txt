2020 Illinois boundary data at block level is removed due to its size. It is obtained from https://redistrictingdatahub.org/state/illinois
We extract its Chicago subdata by matching with 2020 Chicago tract IDs provided by City of Chicago [here.](https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/fin/municipal_depository/ Addendum_2_Attachment_A_Chicago_Census_Tract%20_11_digit.pdf) We clean and save that pdf as chicago_tracts.csv in our data folder.
